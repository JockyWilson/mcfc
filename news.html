<p>Despite going 2 years without an away win in any competition the 7-0 thrashing of Thistle in last season's Group Cup meant hopes of victory were understandably high in the build up to Sunday's clash.  
Unfortunately any prospect of progress was dashed when The Choice had to start the game with only 9 players, despite this they battled to stay in it
during the first period and trailed by a single goal at the break.<br />
The second 45 was a different story with 2 quick Thistle goals effectively ending the contest,<br /> the home side were rampant and added 4 more
before the end.<br />
Paul and Leon both scored and are slugging it out for the golden boot award but the season<br /> is effectively over for The Choice after this latest cup defeat.

 The Choice went crashing out of the Divisional Cup on Sunday after a wind-assisted first half battering left them with a mountain to climb. A valiant 2nd half fightback saw the defecit pegged back to 4-3 but it wasn't enough to prevent another first round cup exit.</p>
<p> Deputy-Gaffer O'Neill stepped in to run things in Paul's absence and blooded 2 new players in Kevin and Adam. The former made an impressive 2-goal debut and Mike's desision to hook him during the 2nd half had Choice fans scratching their heads.  
Despite a stunning 3rd from Pete and some Beckenbauer impressions from Big Mac, MCFC couldn't claw their way back to parity. 
</p> 
<p>Next week's M.A. Cup tie with Clissold Thistle is now massive as defeat would end The Choice's season. Only 3 years ago they contested the M.A. Cup final, fans will be hoping the spirit of '06 can inspire the team and launch another memorable cup run.</p>

 <p>
How can you play football without a ball ? the truth is you can't, so when The Choice turned up without the aforementioned accessory there were
early rumblings from the opposition that a forefit could be on the cards. When the Veras solitary ball was dispatched to football heaven (the roof of the Market
Road changing rooms) the rumblings grew louder, fortunately a scrounging mission enabled the match to be completed.</p>
<p>A first half bombardment from MCFC failed to produce a goal thanks to some inspired keeping and some poor finishing.  
Early in the second period a loud Edinburgh winger broke the deadlock, but it wasn't Leon's 5th league goal of the season, rather the debut strike from man of the match Jay. 
'The King is dead, long live the King', mused Neil McCrindle's Dad, a solitary figure on the terraces. The Kaiser was less impressed with the young Scot's audible appetite<br /> for the ball, "Jay, all I'm hearing is noise", the grumpy German retorted as the winger screamed for a pass. </p>
<p>The Veras pressed hard for an equaliser but Hughesie was not to be denied his annual clean sheet. When Tobias 'Golden Boot' Kaiser bagged a second with ten minutes to play the points were safe, ensuring The Choice go into the four week Christmas break on a high.</p>

	 <p><span style="color:#999966">You can not be serious !,  Choice robbed by shocking referee (... and penalty miss)  </span></p>
 <p>
 Some generous festive season defending and a late spot kick miss saw MCFC's promotion hopes for 2009 evaporate into the crisp Sunday morning air as they went down by the odd<br /> goal in seven. A dogfight at the wrong end of the table now looks more likely and next week's clash with the Veras is a relegation six-pointer. 
It's almost two years since The Choice won an away game in the league but their fans leaving the game will feel this was a match that could and should have been won.
</p>
<p>When Hughesie let a 30 yard squiggler evade his grasp it looked like being a long afternoon<br /> for The Choice. At 2-0 down the away side's fortunes turned when first a speculative cross<br /> and then a scorching long range effort saw Leon drag the score back to parity by half time.<br />
The match was poised to go either way at 3-3 when it turned on two terrible refereeing decisions.<br />First up Leon was denied a perfectly good goal when he was given offside, The Tigers then broke away and scored when clearly offside themselves.<br />
As if trying to atone for a terrible performance the ref awarded a soft penalty to MCFC with ten minutes remaining, this softness was matched by the spot kick effort which was easily saved by the Tiger's keeper.

During this period the team racked up their first wins of the season, coming out on top in 2 of the 4 matches played.

 The Choice were 2 minutes away from making it to the next round of the Group Cup on Sunday when the draw required to progress was denied them in the dying seconds of an epic cup encounter.<br />
 Some poor defending saw The Choice 4-1 down in the second period after The Gaffer had earlier levelled at 1-1, slotting away a Pierre cross. The diminutive Frenchman was on the<br />
  pitch after Leon 'I'm the new Markus Paatelainen' King pulled up with hamstring trouble.<br />
   After switching to a 3-3-4 formation, goals from The Kaiser, Tony 'Andy Murray' Woodcock<br /> and an OG saw MCFC haul it back to 4-4 as the quarter finals beckoned. <br />
A draw would have been enough for the away side to progress but with Angus Deyton pulling the strings Submarine resurfaced with a late winner to send The Choice crashing out.

   <p>The history books have been rewritten after The Kaiser claimed his first goal of the season during Sunday's match against Utlramarine. The misfiring German has stated categorically that the strike originally credited to Pete never happened and the goal was his.

 When the match got underway the team had an experienced old skool look about it, with war veterans Alan, Leon and Laurence all turning out. Big Mac McCrindle returned to  the heart of the MC defence and captained the side, refreshed after a romantic break in Gran Canaria with Leon and Big Stu.<br />
 A first half blitzkrieg from The Choice saw them go in at the break 4-1 up. Paul stormed to the top of the <a href="stats.html" target="_blank">MC scoring charts</a> with more heroics in front of goal while Lawrence, Tobias and Pete notched his first goals of the season. <br />The second half was a rear guard action but MCFC held out to finally record a victory.

 <p>After 8 straight league defeats stretching back over 12 months there was only one man ever likely to stop the rot. The original MC superhero roared into action midway through the first half on Sunday and proceeded to terrorise the Athletico defence.  <br />
Northern were 2-0 up by the time Big Stu arrived on the scene. Originally charged with a watching brief, the big man was quickly told to get stripped as The Choice only had 10 starters. <br />
In the 2nd half MCFC put in their best performance for some time and after a Shipwreck double they had a few gilt-edged opportunities to win the game.<br /> Sadly, it wasn't to be, but with games in hand there could yet be a promotion charge if they continue to show this kind of spirit.<br />

Things got even worse for Seb once he was in the ambulance, &quot;I requested some soulful house&quot;, explained the MC skipper, &quot;But the station they had on was playing traxx house, a drum-oriented variant of Chicago house built around compact drum machines of the late '80s and early '90s, it's not my favorite house sub-genre&quot;.<br />

		 <p>The M.A.L has launched a probe into allegations that players from MCFC and The Groucho Club accepted bribes to get MC Gaffer Paul Rakkar on the score sheet during their recent league match. Several leading British bookmakers reported unusual betting patterns on the game, forcing some to suspend wagers altogether. A William Hill spokesman told us, &quot;Normally Rakkar would be 250/1 to score at anytime during a game, his record of played 109 scored 0 speaks for itself&quot;. A string of bets on The Gaffer saw these odds slashed, and by Sunday morning he was odds-on. The MCFC hierarchy deny any wrong doing and put The Gaffer's prolific goal scoring form down to him, &quot;Looking a bit like Dimitar Berbatov&quot;.

<h4><span style="color:#999966">Choice salvage some pride with 3 goal 2nd half salvo  </span></h4> 
 <p><img src="sofia/21.jpg" alt="" />  </p> 
 <p>A crowd of over 30 turned out in the Sofia sunshine for The Choice's final tour fixture and they were treated to a match that had everything. Goals galore, a missed penalty, red and yellow cards, the linesman playing on the left wing, a dog on the pitch and an impromptu penalty<br />shoot out.  <br />
 Choice fans feared the worst when Bistrica stormed into a 2 goal lead within the first 10 minutes. Despite losing a further goal to go in 3 down at the break the first half was not without chances for the visitors. A Laurence penalty was saved and but for more heroic goal keeping in 1 on 1 situations The Choice could have had another couple.
 <p><span style="color:#999966">Half time 3-0</span><br />
 Bistrica eased off in the 2nd period, bringing on one of their less mobile strikers and feeding him the ball at every opportunity. Choice continued to create chances and finally the goals came with Laurence, Hughesie and Stu all notching in a highly entertaining 2nd half. At one point The Choice had 13 players on the field  
 and were grateful for the services of the pacey linesman who replaced Gaulty. The Ulsterman's fading eyesight and recurring groin strain ensured he was well behind play and unsighted as the Choice attack pored forward with scant regard for the offside laws.<br />
After drawing the 2nd half 3-3 a 14-a-side penalty shoot out ensued before both teams retired to the bar. Vitosha Bistrica and the officials provided us with one of the most enjoyable matches in tour history and for that we thank them.

 Zheleznica took the lead after 15 minutes but Choice didn't fold and when The Kaiser was played in by a delightful Andy through ball the veteran marksman produced a stunning finish to level the scores 10 minutes before the break.
 <p><span style="color:#999966">Half time 1-1</span><br />
 the 2nd half started well enough but when the inspirational Gary Ryan was forced off through injury the home team went for the jugular. They retook the lead after 58 minutes and by the 70th minute it was 7-1. In the gathering gloom there were few complaints when the referee blew up with a quarter of an hour still to play. Officially it was "Getting a bit dark" but rumours that he was slipped a couple of lev to put The Choice out of their misery are probably true.

		<p>The Bulgarian FA were last night accused of 'Compromising the integrity of Music Choice FC' when the match schedule was announced for Tour Number 7. A chaotic fixture pile-up means The Choice will be forced to play a match just 6 hours after landing in Sofia. An insider (who does not wish to be named, we'll call him 'Shipwreck') voiced his anger at the administrators, &quot;It's a scandal, how are we supposed to prepare properly with only a few hours of drinking time before the match ? &quot;. Leading sports psychologist and right winger Dr Leon King gave us a deeper insight into the problem, &quot;We just cannae play if we're no reekin' like&quot; declared King.  </p>

<p>With only two games left to play for the Choicers, so many questions
remain unanswered: Can the Choice stay up?** Do they want to? Is Chris
O'Neil playing? Who are we playing? What pitch are we on? Is it Harry or
Ari? Who's that Frenchman? Who's got a fiver for the ref? Who's doing
the kit (probably Neil)?<br />

With a bare bones squad of 4 all ready to play, Paul called his mate
Dennis Wise who said he had spotted some top talent in a hotel bar. The
Gaffer trotted down immediately to see the skills. 'He knew how to pour
a pint of Guinness with a cockrel on it, so I knew he must be French'
said a distraught Gaffer. 4 pints later and the squad was complete.<br />
Estefan, Gloria to his friends, slotted into the centre of midfield
alongside the Stevey Davey, still buoyant after Spurs' Carling Cup
triumph. Other new additions included Irish Rob and Colin (origin
unknown). The Choice battled hard and replied immediately whenever
Tufnell Park Rangers scored from a cross (Hughesie's aversion to garlic
and crosses has earned him the nickname Nosferatu amongst the regulars
at the Tennis Court end). Colin equalised first and then Estefan with a
swirling free kick.<br />

The second half saw ugly scenes with with two Choicers (surprisingly not
Bernie) getting booked. Another goal from TPR was cancelled out by Colin
(origin unknown), but it was TPR who had the last laugh. Marvin hit the
post twice in the dying seconds but it was not to be.<br />

With Choice's season all but over, the Gaffer will be looking for some
consolation Goose to eat with his Guiness over the last two games.

The Choice started sprightly with Birdo's mate Kev filling the hole in
midfield alongside Seb and the ol' warhorses of Wemyss A and Kaiser back
upfront. The Choice went a goal down after a touch of pinball inside the
area. No one was to blame, least of all Hughesie. The Choice took it on
the chin and clawed back to 1-1 when The Stevey Davey scored direct from
a corner (with a little help from Lady Breeze).</p>
<p><span style="color:#999966">Half time 1-1 </span></p>
<p>
The second half was a different story. The Choice rarely looked like
scoring and lacked a fox in the box. Hughesie regained his in-form
status briefly when he saved a stinging shot to his right. But this was
short lived when he went the way of all great keepers and had a
veritable mare from then on in. Think James, think Robinson, think
Rakkar. The first was an inswinging freekick which 'gathered pace' as
the Outback strikers closed in. Next a deflected shot soared past, then
a poorly constructed wall helped not one bit. The fifth was a failed
header on the line from birdo; he blamed the sun this time. The rout was
complete with a ball down the left channel and an unprotected near post.

A poor display all round. Coach Rakkar will be looking to add a striker
to the team in the transfer window. I hear Darren Bent is available. </p>

<p>Under the floodlights the sounds of Arsenal v Chelsea could be heard in
the distance and the verses to Parklife on the pitch*. NME took an early
lead with a scuffed shot which looped over the in-form Hughesie, giving
firm evidence that you can't run backwards. The Choice worked well after
the goal and forced a toe poke from Oliver which found the corner of the
net.<br />
As the game got more tense the atmosphere got colder, due to a drop in
temperature. NME held a lot of possession, and forced some saves
although they were straight at the goalie. Choice went close to a wonder
goal from on loan Michael, but it scraped wide.<br />
 Then, as art imitated
life in some way, just as Arsenal grabbed a late winner not 200 yards
down the road from a goalkeeping howler, NME got a dubious free kick
 and the resulting shot was parried into the net from Hughesie (no longer in
form). Heads left shoulders and were lost as NME quickly got a 3rd. A
disappointing end to a tightly fought game. </p>

<p> Despite an improved display and the official debut of the enigmatic Stevey Davey, Sunday's narrow defeat to the league leaders saw The Choice go crashing out of the Group Cup.<br /> 
Pre-match preparation was not ideal, with star man Laurence G Diddy stuck in traffic The Choice were forced to start with the old warhorse up front that is The Kaiser. The Gaffer took one for the team that featured two Andy Wemyss look-a-likes in the centre of midfield (Martin Mace and Andy Wemyss).<br /> Gower started strongly making a number of penetrating runs and probing through balls, The Choice kept them at bay but eventually they were caught out when Neil (or Chris) was turned and Gower slotted the ball past an advancing (and in-form) Hughesie.
</p><p><span style="color:#999966">Half time 1-0 </span></p>
<p>Changes were afoot at half time with The Gaffer making a bold triple substitution. The referee was French in the second half as Gower's ref hadn't  turned up so Mat stepped in, making apologies aplenty for a series of awful decisions.<br /> 
Gower took advantage early by scoring a goal that was not only offside but put in by new right back and throw-in nightmare Jason. Laurent then added to the choice injury list and The Gaffer was graciously allowed to return to the fray. Having reinvented himself as a striker or winger The Gaffer was reeking havok with his searing pace and pinpoint passing. The Choice stepped up a gear and a long raking free kick by the enigmatic Stevey Davey was fumbled into his own net by the Gower keeper. Back in the game, The Choice battled forward trying to force an equaliser, and the away fans didn't have long to wait for it. After a game of head tennis in the six yard box and a debatable offside shout, Andy Wemyss forced the ball home off a Gower head to set up a grandstand finish.<br /> 
With The Choice holding on, Gower pushed forward and in the dying moments a weak back header from Neil didn't quite have the legs to find  an in-form Hughesie and a Gower striker snuck in to tap it over the keeper's head for the winning goal.</p>

 A weekend of football that began with huge amounts of optimism and hope, ended in abject disappointment on a muddy Tufnell Park on Sunday.
The possible 'Scotland qualify for the Euro and MCFC get off the bottom of the table' double finished as a total zero. Even worse it was the pesky cheating Italians to blame again for Scotland's misery and the Music Choice failure to get 11 players out which finished them off.<br />  
A makeshift 10 took the field against a determined Jubilee in a relegation 9 pointer. Attacking outlets were limited with only one up front and minimal width apart from alcohol induced waistlines. The ten men defended gallantly and kept it to 0-0 at half time.<br />
<span style="color:#999966">Half time 0-0</span><br />
  Energy levels were waning in the second half with hangovers, illness and general disinterest taking their toll. Even the inform Hughsie's heroics could not keep the scores level. Jubilee scored 3, we scored none. On to next week and the welcome distraction of potential cup glory.<br />

 <p><b>&quot;Where were the Drugs ??&quot;</b><br />
Not even an almost competent performance from Tony  &quot;Are you on drugs Ref ?&quot; Andrade could halt the steamroller that was  FC Music Choice on Sunday. A resounding 7-0 victory against the mighty Clissold Thistle brought our unbeaten streak to exactly one.<br /> With three new signings in the squad, MC were at full strength with 14 players for only the second time this season. The not quite Big Brother Twins (Mike and Roger)  and Omer lined up for the first time in Music Choice colours and added some strength in depth. Mike having won three rounds of paper, rock, scissors went straight into the first eleven. &quot; I have been on the phone to the President and told him just what's happened here with the new boys. Three times he used paper and three times he won.<br /> El Presidente said that's just the decisiveness we need, put him straight in. &quot;What he lacks in imagination can be compensated with the drugs&quot; the Gaffer told waiting hacks.<br />
Choice took a comfortable two nil lead before half time. Surprisingly few poor decisions were made by Tony. A crowd gathered pitch side and the chants went up &quot; Where are your drugs Tony ?&quot;. Correctly blowing the whistle on a full 45 mins only fueled rumors that this man was indeed clean.<br />
<span style="color:#999966">Half time 2-0</span><br /> 
Choice continued their ascendancy in the second half with a further 5 goals. Simeon scoring 4, new boy Mike scoring his second hat trick of the day with 3 and Seb getting punched in an extremely feminine manner by a frustrated Thistle. Midfield work horse Martin somehow managed to break his nose prompting at least 16 subsequent uses of the phrase &quot;I think your nose is broken&quot;.<br />
With game nearly over, drugs were conspicuous by their absence. Even local wandering minstrel Pete Doherty who watched most of the second half with Big Stu as a sort of substitute Leon had nothing but tabs and poor tunes. Even left back Bernie refused to hug the lines and was remarkably coherent.<br />
With only a few seconds remaining the crowd got what they had come for. A lofted ball into the Choice penalty box brought cries of &quot;keeper&quot; from the Gaffer who was deputising for the inform Hughesie.  As the ball fell, overcome by some hallucinogenic the Gaffer performed a little dance and had a giggle whilst the ball bounced dangerously across the box. Only quick thinking from Mike Mikey Mike O'Neil avoided an almost chance at goal. As Tony blew his whistle he wondered over and asked the question &quot; Are you on drugs or something?&quot;. Most probably.<br />

			<p>Another valiant attempt to beat the 'étoile rouge' ended in disappointment for The Choice on Sunday. A late flurry of goals gave the score line a flattering sheen for the under strength home side who had struggled to kill off the 10 men of MCFC. The Choice contained Red Star for the first 15 mins until a freak 40 yard effort intended as a cross ended up in the top corner. 10 minutes later an unfortunate own goal from Neil made it 2-0 to the home side, rough justice for a battling Choice side. <br /> <span style="color:#999966">Half time 2-0</span><br /> 
The second half started well for MCFC, ploughing a lone furrow up front Simeon ran at the Red Star defence, beat two men, and slotted the ball home. A stirring comeback seemed on the cards and then .... disaster ! Young Andy Wemyss tore a muscle in his leg. Forced to go between the sticks, he followed in the heroic footsteps of previous error-prone Scottish keepers (Alan Rough, Jim Leighton, Sir Jackie Stewart) and let in a howler of a third goal. Two further strikes compounded the visitors misery as another chance to beat Red Star slipped away.  <br />
The Choice are struggling to keep their season alive and now face 2 must-win games against Clissold Thistle in the  Group Cup and Jubilee in the league.<br />

The wind was whistling in their britches in the first half and Choice went into the break 1-0 up after a quick throw-in from Simeon found Martin who drove home. Jubilee came close once with keeper Hughes tipping over from 15 yards.<br /> <span style="color:#999966">Half time 1-0</span><br /> 
 Against the wind in the second half The Choice had a bit more to deal with at the back but most of the Jubilee attacks ended with an over hit through ball. Choice went close through Simeon's audacious scissor kick volley but it was The Kaiser who finished off the game after turning in a rebound from a Simeon shot. No goals for goal machine Simeon but 2 assists ensure he stays top of the MC Fantasy League Table. A rejuvenated Kaiser was delighted to get back on the score sheet, since battling back from his broken arm he has shed 1 ounce and it certainly showed when he pounced like a cat to apply the coup de grâce.  <br />

	        <h2>On the spot : Simeon</h2>
			 <p><span style="color:#999966">New goal scoring sensation takes questions from the fans</span></p>
			 <p><b>MCFC :</b>Dr Pangloss from Prestatyn writes &quot;Simeon, did you realise that in classical rabbinical sources, the name Simeon is sometimes interpreted as meaning &quot;he who listens [to the words of God]&quot; (Genesis Rabbah 61:4), and at other times thought to derive from sham 'in, meaning &quot;there is sin&quot;, which is argued to be a prophetic reference to Zimri's sexual miscegenation with a Midianite woman, a type of relationship which rabbinical sources regard as sinful ?&quot;<br />
			 <b>Simeon :</b> yes<br />
			 <b>MCFC :</b> Paul Cezanne, also from Prestatyn, has written in to say &quot;Simeon, you're a hero with the Prestatyn MCFC supporters club, where on earth would we be this season without your goals ?&quot;<br />
			 <b>Simeon :</b> ha ha, thanks Richard, probably bottom of the league !<br />
			 <b>MCFC :</b> they are bottom of the league<br />
			 <b>Simeon :</b> oh, well they'd probably have fewer points<br />
			 <b>MCFC :</b> they haven't got any points<br />
			 <b>Simeon :</b> oh<br />
			 <b>MCFC :</b> taxi for Simeon</p>

	     <p><span style="color:#999966">21.10.07 - League -  Match report gleaned from notes by Hughesie</span></p>
			<p>Despite the return of the Original G Diddy, the Romford Rocket, the man they call Laurence Green (because that's his name), MCFC were unable to secure their first league points of the season. A scrambled effort after Hughesie failed to deal with a cross was all that separated the sides at half time in this top v bottom clash as The Choice looked to build on last week's cup draw.<br />  <span style="color:#999966">Half time 1-0</span><br /> 
 A deflected second goal seemed to have killed of The Choice but 'goal machine' Simeon popped up to give the away fans hope when he netted his second strike on an many games. Hope of a first league point was ended late on when the league leaders notched a third to secure all three points, a result which sees them stay top.  <br />
<span style="color:#999966">Full time 3-1</span></p>

 
	  <h2><span style="color:#FF0000">Result : Crown &amp; Goose 1-1 Music Choice</span></h2>
			<p><span style="color:#999966">14.10.07 - Group Cup -  Match report filed by Comrade Hughesie</span> <br /></p>
			<p>This was a very even game and a draw was probably a fair result. Both teams went
close in the first half and only the heroics of the Choice keeper (not
my words, the words of TV Quick) prevented Goose from going one up
from a free kick (a free kick that was originally a penalty but the ref
had a change of heart after the Choice players talked him round).<br /> 
<span style="color:#999966">Half time 0-0</span><br /> 
An equally even second half ensued with both
teams failing to truly test each other's keeper but it was Choice who
broke the deadlock on about 75 minutes after a fine move which ended in
a close range effort from new signing Simeon. Choice looked certain to
hold on and take an important three points in this Group Cup match but
it was not to be. Herman beat Wemyss on the right wing and managed to get a cross in, 
the Choice defence failed to clear and a Goose sub turned and slotted
the ball into the bottom right corner with almost the
last kick of the game.<br />
<span style="color:#999966">Full time 1-1</span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#999966">Cup provides welcome distraction from league woes</span></p>
		
			<p>The Gaffer has had a vote of confidence from The Board and is looking to kick-start MCFC's season with a cup win this Sunday against The Crown &amp; Goose. &quot;We are hungry&quot; growled The Gaffer, &quot;Goose is on the menu and we intend to devour it. We are lean and mean, The Goose has been getting fat, that slows it down, it will be easier to catch&quot;.  </p>
			
			
	        <h2>New season starts slowly for The Choice</h2>
			<p><span style="color:#999966">Room for improvement as MCFC face relegation battle</span></p>
			<p>It's not been an ideal start to season 2007/08. A showpiece curtain-raiser against Red Star Camden turned into a 13-2 romp for the perennial champions. Week 2 saw a marked improvement but despite being 2-0 up at half time MCFC lost out 3-2 to Outback. This battling performance turned out to be a false dawn and a 9-1 hammering from Tufnell Park the following week saw Choice firmly rooted to the bottom of the table.<br />
			   Week 4 was one of MCFC's darkest hours. Only 7 players turned out on Sunday October 7th 2007 for the match against Virgin NME. The match was forfeited and The Choice remain pointless.</p>
