			<h2>2002 Prague</h2>
			<p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/Prague team 1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
			<p>The first tour, and for many of the a first taste of cheap Czech beer and absinth. With the worst collective hangovers ever taken onto a pitch MCFC were soundly thrashed 5-1 by a bunch of 'old boys' somewhere on the outskirts of Prague. Long nights were spent at a 4 story riverside club which had...ahem...’something for everyone’.</p>

				<h2>2003 Budapest</h2>
 <p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/budapest.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Apparently Budapest is a beautiful city, it was hard to tell as almost the entire time was spent at 'Rio' on the banks of the Danube. The tour is best remembered for The Kaiser's infamous 'garden furniture' incident (currency changed hands to smooth things over). There was a brief football moment when The Choice encountered FC Taban for the first time. MCFC only had 11 players, and despite the 90 degree heat they say off those Magyars 9-1. So good was the performance that we made the local newspaper.  </p>

<h2>2004 Krakow</h2>
 <p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/krakow.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A first trip to Poland and with Marv & Laurence replaced by Leon & The Shipwreck things were always going to be tough on the pitch. So it proved as FC Taban drove all the way from Budapest to exact a savage revenge. USA 1-0 England, Hereford Utd 2-1 Newcastle and now FC Taban 1-0 Music Choice. Off the pitch it was the unlikely sounding 'Prozac' where the evening entertainment took place. The White Russians flowed long into the night (and back out through Hughesie's nostrils the next morning).</p>

<h2>2005 Bratislava</h2>
 <p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/brat.jpg" alt="" /></p>
 <p>A massive squad of 20 set sail for Slovakia, the country may have changed but we ended up playing FC Taban again as attempts to secure local opposition proved fruitless. The Choice exacted revenge in a generally forgettable match, illuminated only by Shipwreck Stu’s wonder goal. Hotel Kyjev wasn’t the last word in modern luxury accommodation but beneath it’s imposing, shabby exterior lay a certain cold war charm (if you ignored the cockroaches). Surprisingly, no single venue was found for the recreational activities.  </p>

<h2>2006 Gdansk</h2>
 <p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/gdansk1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A pirate ship floating past the hotel, games played one day underwater, 
the next day on rocks and sand, and of course Simon Weston, Britain's 
favourite burnt man. It could only happen in Gdansk. The Choice took a more pared-down squad back to Poland and put in two commendable performances against local works teams. In a deluge on the outskirts of town only a late goal denied MCFC the win, but in impossible conditions the draw was probably a fair result. The following day, on the worst pitch in Europe, class told after a slow start and sloppy concession in the first half, as Choice ran out 5-1 winners. The team warmed down in Sopot-on-Sea where the 'Tutunka' - bison grass vodka and apple juice - was discovered, leading to an unfortunate bout of harassment of the staff of Any Question Answered, a sunburned arse for Jurgen and Bernie's list of five films that can "stand up". Caspian, Waterworld...   </p>

<h2>2007 Zagreb</h2>
 <p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/zagreb.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to hold your hands up. During a bank robbery, 
for instance, or when a semi-pro team turns up with a squad of 26, all of 
whom play. In the very finest of tour surroundings, Choice mixed sumptuous 
luxury off the pitch with liberal batterings on it. The five-star Regent 
Esplanade (courtesy Kerner/McKinsey productions) hosted an unfamiliar playing squad, shorn of its youthful summer signings and studded instead with Scottish drunks. The carousing was therefore impressive, the results less so. Against the aforementioned ND Buzin, a rearguard action on the most manicured of surfaces kept the score to 1-0 at half-time, and when Seb scored to make it 1-1, hopes were raised. Legs, though, were gone. Team #2 were fit and rampant, knocking in eight more without reply. Next
day, Choice were “bolstered” up front by the portly stylings of former French league journeyman Tony Roman, as Neil had broken his wrist and Leon’s groin strain meant, if it were possible, even less running. Thus depleted, the team shipped another 12 goals, scoring 3 in turn, before thoughts quickly turned to beer and Paul's Stevie Wonder impression. Much pasta was consumed at Zvonomir Boban's restaurant, there was a terrible FA Cup final at the new Wembley, and just horrible, incredible amounts of beer. This couldn't be the end, could it...?</p>

<h2>2008 Sofia</h2>
<p><img src="gallery/Team Pics/sofiateam.jpg" alt="" /></p>
 <p>As the Bulgarian road-menders’ strike entered its second decade, Music Choice FC landed in Sofia to inflict their appropriately uneven brand of football on two local league sides.<br />

A striking sight greets you on the run into the city: a ring of mountains crowned by Mount Vitosha (2,280m) – apparently Sofia is the only European capital from which you can go skiing on public transport. It is certainly imposing and even in the warm temperatures of late May retained a cap of snow.<br />

So from the balmy heat of our town centre hotel, the team was whisked upwards, bumpily, into the cool of the surrounding hills, thence – and mostly in shorts and flip-flops – to be dumped on by the sort of downpour not experienced since, well, since the first game in Gdansk two years ago.<br />

FC Zheleznica (Bulgarian 4th division) were the latest benficiaries of the Gaffer’s policy of matching the Choice against far stronger European foes, but the monsoon conditions proved a levelling force. Thanks to a beautifully weighted pass from Wemyss A and deftly lobbed finish from the Kaiser, Choice went in at the break level. However, as happened against Buzin last year, the exertions of the first half reaped exhaustion in the second, and as the rain relented, the home side were rampant, running out 7-1 winners.<br />

Next day, and with the unfortunate news that Seb and Bernie were stranded in Stansted, a yet stronger team (3rd division) awaited in Vitosha Bistrica. This time the gulf in class was immediately apparent, with two stunning goals in the first 10 minutes putting paid to any thoughts of a genuine contest. Especially as the ref then started to favour, and indeed sometimes play for, the Choice. A reshuffle of personnel from Bistrica, with up front the largest centre forward seen since the days of Acorn, led to a park-football feel in the second half, a 6-3 scoreline, and an impromptu penalty shoot-out as the sun set. Despite the lack of real competition, most were agreed, over a generous helping of free beer in the bar, that it was one of the best days of all tours.<br />

With the football out of the way, 28 tired legs were revived by the local brew – Zagorka – decidedly unlocal pizzas at Coliseum and a sampling of the nightlife (sex tourism optional). We were guided around the city by Mike O’Neill’s friend Martin 'Marty' Martin and our charming hotel receptionist Maria, took in Portsmouth’s first Cup final win since 1939, and two who shall remain nameless learnt that a strip club at 4am is still a bad place for a nightcap, even in Bulgaria.<br />

The usual mix, then, of bad football and good times. One suspects there’s more to come.
